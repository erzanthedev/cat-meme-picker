# 🐱 Cat Meme Picker

### A Fun Way to Choose Your Favorite Cat Memes! 😹

---

## 📌 Overview

**Cat Meme Picker** is a fun and interactive project that lets users **pick their favorite cat memes** based on selected filters. This project was built as part of **Scrimba’s Frontend Developer Career Course** under the **Essential JavaScript Concepts** module.

The **main goal** of this project was to **practice and reinforce JavaScript skills** while working with:

- **Loops & array methods** to manipulate and filter data.
- **DOM manipulation techniques** to handle user interactions.
- **Form inputs like radio buttons & checkboxes** for dynamic filtering.

The project started with a **starter pack code**, which included some HTML, CSS, and a small JavaScript snippet that looped through an **array of objects (CatsData)**. From there, I expanded upon it to make it fully functional.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- Strengthen my **JavaScript fundamentals** with **real-world application**.
- **Improve DOM manipulation skills** using **querySelector** and **getElementsByClassName**.
- **Enhance UI interactivity** by using checkboxes, radio buttons, and event handling.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML** – Structure for displaying cat memes.
- **CSS** – Styling to make the page visually appealing.
- **JavaScript** – Main logic for filtering and displaying cat memes dynamically.

## 🚀 Key Concepts Practiced

This project helped reinforce the following **JavaScript concepts**:

✅ **for...of loop** – To iterate through the array of cat meme data.  
✅ **Import/export** – To structure and modularize the code.  
✅ **Radio & checkbox inputs** – For user selection and filtering.  
✅ **querySelector** – To target elements efficiently.  
✅ **getElementsByClassName** – To manipulate multiple elements at once.  
✅ **classList.remove** – To dynamically update the UI.  
✅ **includes()** – To check for specific values within arrays.  
✅ **.filter()** – To filter data based on user preferences.

## 📌 How It Works

1. **Users select their preferences** using radio buttons and checkboxes.
2. **JavaScript filters the CatsData array** based on the selected options.
3. **Filtered memes are displayed dynamically** on the page.
4. **Users can modify selections** to see different memes instantly.

## 🔧 Future Improvements

🔹 **Add a “random meme” button** for fun, unexpected meme selections.  
🔹 **Improve UI/UX** with animations and hover effects.  
🔹 **Enhance responsiveness** to optimize the experience on mobile devices.
